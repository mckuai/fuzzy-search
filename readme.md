# Fuzzy-V-Lookup

The notebook for the fuzzy search is named **Refactor_Fuzzy-lookup.ipynb** and it is modified to work with large files.

In order to use this notebook all the dependencies that are in the <code>requirementes.txt</code> file need to be installed. 
> This could be done by runing <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code> command once you have created a new environment for the project.

## Creating a new environment:

To create a new environment using anaconda you can use
<code> conda create --name 'name of environment' python==3.8.0 </code>

being *'name of environment'* whatever you like to name your virtual environment, but remember to establish python to 3.8 version.
