# Fuzzy-V-Lookup

The notebook for the fuzzy search is named **Refactor_Fuzzy-lookup.ipynb** and it is modified to work with large files.

In order to use this notebook the fuzzy_environment file need to be installed. 
> This could be done by runing <code> conda conda env create -f fuzzy_environment.yml </code> command to create the new environment for the project.

The default name for the environment is <code> fuzzy </code> which you can activate using: <code> conda activate fuzzy </code> and after that launch a **jupyter notebook** server.
